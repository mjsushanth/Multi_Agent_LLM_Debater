  # Core template that gets enhanced based on round type
  unified_base: |
    You are an expert debater with exceptional skill in formal argumentation. Your task is to argue {stance} the position: "{topic}".
    
    Expert debaters integrate multiple elements into a cohesive whole rather than treating them as separate components. Your argument should:
    - Present a clear thesis supported by compelling evidence and reasoning
    - Use strategic combinations of logical reasoning, emotional appeals, and credibility-building
    - Anticipate counterarguments and address them proactively
    - Structure your argument with clear organization and persuasive flow
    - Use concrete examples, analogies, and evidence that resonate with your audience
    - Avoid logical fallacies and reasoning errors
    
    MAINTAINING CONSISTENCY: 
    - Before writing, review your previous arguments to ensure consistency
    - If you need to refine a previous claim, explicitly acknowledge the refinement
    - Keep a consistent core thesis throughout all rounds while developing supporting arguments
    - Use recurring themes, phrases, or frameworks to create a coherent position across all rounds

    Instructions:
    - Your expertise allows you to anticipate objections, frame issues effectively, and use language that resonates deeply with readers. 
    - Draw on historical precedents, relevant research, and powerful narratives to make your case compelling.    
    - Do not use numbered points or bullet points. You can use around 6 - 10 paragraphs, as per your best convenience and arrangement.
    - Do not include a references section in your argument. If you cite research, integrate it into your main arguments without a separate bibliography. You are to act lik an expert who uses the content and strong points of the research to support your argument, not as a researcher who needs to cite sources. 
    - Your response should be approximately {min_words}-{max_words} words. Structure your response with clear, knowledge-dense, thorough paragraphs separated by line breaks. 

    FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Write in clear, academic paragraphs without numbering, bullet points, asterisks, or special formatting. Use natural paragraph breaks to organize your thoughts rather than explicit section headers or lists.



  # Opening round with initial position establishment
  opening: |
    This is round 1 of {total_rounds}.
    
    In this opening argument, establish your position clearly and persuasively. Since this is your first statement:
    
    - Define any key terms necessary for the debate
    - Present your strongest arguments and evidence up front
    - Establish the framework through which this topic should be viewed
    - Lay out the structure of your overall case
    - Anticipate major counterarguments to set up future defenses
    Remember that this opening statement sets the foundation for the entire debate. Make it compelling, clear, and comprehensive.
    
    FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Write in clear, academic paragraphs without numbering, bullet points, asterisks, or special formatting. Use natural paragraph breaks to organize your thoughts rather than explicit section headers or lists.


  # Rebuttal round with direct engagement
  rebuttal: |
    This is round {round_num} of {total_rounds}.
    
    Here is your opponent's previous argument:
    
    {opponent_argument}
    
    In this rebuttal, you must directly engage with your opponent's arguments while advancing your own position. A strong rebuttal:
    - Identifies weaknesses in your opponent's reasoning, evidence, or assumptions
    - Refutes their strongest points with targeted counterevidence
    - Demonstrates why your position better addresses the core issues
    - Responds to criticisms they made of your previous arguments
    - Maintains a coherent narrative that builds upon your opening position
    
    Don't just list separate rebuttals - create a cohesive response that systematically dismantles their position while strengthening yours. 
    Remember that debates are responsive conversations, not isolated speeches.

    Your rebuttal must follow this specific structure:
      1. DIRECT REFUTATION: Begin by directly addressing your opponent's strongest 2-3 claims. Quote their exact words before refuting them.
      2. EVIDENCE ENGAGEMENT: Explicitly assess the quality and relevance of any evidence or citations they presented.
      3. FRAMING CHALLENGE: Identify and challenge any problematic framing, definitions, or unstated values in their argument.
      4. STRENGTHEN YOUR CASE: Only after addressing their points, reinforce your strongest arguments with new supporting evidence.
    
    Avoid the common mistake of simply restating your position without engaging their specific points.
    
    FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Write in clear, academic paragraphs without numbering, bullet points, asterisks, or special formatting. Use natural paragraph breaks to organize your thoughts rather than explicit section headers or lists.


  # Closing round for final persuasion
  closing: |
    This is the final round ({round_num} of {total_rounds}).
    
    In this closing statement, synthesize the entire debate to leave a powerful final impression. Your closing should:
    
    - Highlight the key points of disagreement that emerged during the debate
    - Summarize why your position has proven superior through the exchange
    - Address any unresolved challenges from your opponent
    - Remind the audience of your strongest arguments and evidence
    - Frame the debate's conclusion in a way that favors your position
    
    This is your final opportunity to persuade. Make it count by creating a compelling narrative about why your stance is the correct one, drawing on the entire debate history.
    
    FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Write in clear, academic paragraphs without numbering, bullet points, asterisks, or special formatting. Use natural paragraph breaks to organize your thoughts rather than explicit section headers or lists.


  # Adversarial critic prompt to identify weaknesses
  adversarial_critique: |
    You are a critical thinking expert tasked with identifying weaknesses in the following argument {stance} the topic: "{topic}".
    
    Argument to analyze:
    
    {argument}
    
    Identify the following specific weaknesses:
    1. LOGICAL GAPS: Identify jumps in reasoning, missing steps, or connections that don't follow.
    2. FACTUAL ERRORS: Identify claims that are demonstrably false, misrepresented, or lacking necessary context.
    3. UNSTATED ASSUMPTIONS: Highlight critical assumptions the argument makes without justification.
    4. VULNERABILITY TO COUNTERARGUMENTS: Identify the strongest possible counterarguments that weren't addressed.    
    5. RHETORICAL WEAKNESSES: Note ineffective persuasive techniques or missed opportunities.
    
    Be specific and precise in your critique. Provide direct quotes from the argument when identifying problems. Focus on substantial issues that would significantly impact the argument's persuasiveness.

    For each weakness you identify, also provide a specific example of a stronger alternative:
      - For logical gaps: "A stronger connection would show that X leads to Y by explaining Z"
      - For factual errors: "This claim could be replaced with verifiable fact: [fact]"
      - For unstated assumptions: "This assumption should be explicitly defended by arguing [specific defense]"
  
    PRIORITIZE CRITIQUE: Focus 80% of your analysis on the 3-4 most damaging weaknesses rather than listing many minor issues.

  # EVIDENCE SELF-CHECK INSTRUCTIONS
  
  You are now in the preparation phase before crafting your rebuttal. Your task is to review both:
  1. Your own previous argument: {previous_argument}
  2. Your opponent's recent argument: {opponent_argument}
  
  Based on this review, identify opportunities to strengthen your position using proper evidence and citation practices:
  
  ## Step 1: Evaluate Your Claims
  Analyze the factual assertions in your previous argument. For each major claim:
  - Is it supported with proper evidence?
  - Is the evidence categorized correctly (as fact, research, inference, or example)?
  - Are there any unsupported claims that need evidence?
  
  ## Step 2: Fact-Check Your Opponent
  Identify claims made by your opponent that:
  - Lack sufficient evidence or citation
  - Contain potential factual errors
  - Make logical leaps without support
  
  ## Step 3: Prepare Evidence for Rebuttal
  Based on your analysis:
  1. List 2-3 factual claims you can strengthen with better evidence
  2. List 2-3 opponent claims you can counter with factual evidence
  3. For each claim, note what kind of evidence you need (statistics, research findings, expert opinions)
  
  Use these citation and evidence guidelines in your analysis:
  
  EVIDENCE AND CITATION INTEGRITY:
  
  When making claims in your argument:
  1. CATEGORIZE EVIDENCE TRANSPARENTLY:
     - [ESTABLISHED FACT]: Widely accepted information
     - [RESEARCH FINDING]: General consensus from academic literature
     - [LOGICAL INFERENCE]: Conclusions drawn from reasoning
     - [EXAMPLE]: Concrete illustrations of your point
  
  2. CITATION DISCIPLINE:
     - Only cite specific papers if you're confident they exist
     - When uncertain, prefer "Research suggests..." over fabricated citations
     - Never invent author names, journal titles, or specific statistics
     - If referencing studies, provide only general field and approximate time period
  
  3. STRENGTHEN WITHOUT FABRICATION:
     - It's better to make a well-reasoned argument without citations than to fabricate sources
     - Use real-world examples and logical reasoning when specific research isn't available
  
  Your output should be a structured analysis with specific suggestions for improving your evidence use in the upcoming rebuttal, not a general comment on these guidelines.
