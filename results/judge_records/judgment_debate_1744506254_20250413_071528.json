        "raw_evaluation": "**PERSUASIVE QUALITY SCORE: 8**\n\n**CRITIQUE:**\n\nThe debater delivered a compelling closing speech with a clear thesis advocating for balanced funding between STEM and humanities. The argument was structured effectively, transitioning smoothly from one point to the next, though minor repetitions could have been avoided for greater conciseness.\n\nEmotional appeal was present through language like \"resilient citizens,\" yet storytelling or anecdotes were absent, which might have deepened audience engagement. The use of case studies in healthcare ethics was commendable but could be enhanced with a narrative to evoke stronger emotions.\n\nLanguage and style were sophisticated without being overly technical, though some jargon could be simplified for broader accessibility. The tone was professional but lacked warmth; incorporating personal stories could humanize the argument further.\n\nAnticipating counterarguments was handled well by referencing OECD support and strategic investments. However, directly rebutting the opponent's 2019 OECD reference with specific context would strengthen the argument. Highlighting the negative impacts of neglecting humanities could provide a more comprehensive defense.\n\nOverall, the speech flowed logically, creating a cohesive narrative that effectively tied together the necessity of balanced funding. While areas for improvement exist, the debater demonstrated strong rhetorical skill and persuasive quality.",

However, deeply entrenched beliefs may require more compelling evidence or personal stories to change.\n\n- **Neutral Listeners**: The combination of data and anecdotes makes the case persuasive for neutrals, as it addresses both economic and ethical considerations, appealing to a wide range of values.\n\n- **Supportive Audiences**: The arguments reinforce existing support with new evidence and examples, potentially deepening their conviction through specific cases and data.\n\n**CRITIQUE**:\n\nThe speaker successfully employs a multi-perspectival approach by integrating quantitative data (OECD reports) and qualitative insights (design thinking examples), which broadens appeal. However, the use of jargon could alienate some listeners.
