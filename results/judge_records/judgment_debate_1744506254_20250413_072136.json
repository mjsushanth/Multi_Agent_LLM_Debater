The reliance on generalized claims about the economic contributions of humanities lacks specific evidence from credible sources such as academic studies or reports from reputable organizations like the OECD. While the OECD indeed advocates for a well-rounded education, providing concrete examples and data-backed analyses would strengthen these assertions.\n\nThe debater correctly highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in fostering innovation but fails to provide specific instances where this synergy has led to significant breakthroughs. For instance, mentioning case studies or academic papers that detail successful collaborations between STEM and humanities could substantiate claims about design thinking\u2019s impact.\n\nRegarding ethical reasoning, while it is true that humanities disciplines offer a more comprehensive exploration of moral issues, the debater does not adequately support this claim with specific examples or scholarly references. Including detailed accounts from interdisciplinary research in fields like bioethics would enhance credibility here.\n\nThe debater accurately notes the importance of critical thinking skills but omits evidence showing how these skills translate into economic benefits and career success. Citing studies on employer preferences for such skills, as highlighted by the Association of American Colleges & Universities, would bolster this argument.\n\nA significant omission is the acknowledgment of potential budget constraints and trade-offs in educational funding decisions. Addressing how strategic investments can optimize both STEM and humanities education within limited resources would provide a more balanced perspective.\n\nWhile there are no direct contradictions within the debater\u2019s claims, the lack of detailed evidence for some assertions reduces overall factual accuracy. The sources cited\u2014such as OECD reports\u2014are credible but require deeper elaboration to support broader conclusions about educational funding. Future arguments should include more specific examples and robust data from peer-reviewed studies and expert analyses to enhance factual integrity.\n\nIn summary, while the debater\u2019s position is largely accurate, it could benefit from more comprehensive evidence, detailed case studies, and nuanced discussions of economic constraints and opportunities in educational investment.",
