They acknowledged valid points from the opposition while engaging with ideas rather than attacking persons or motives, demonstrating an adept respect for opposing viewpoints even while disagreeing. Their argumentative integrity was strong as they used legitimate persuasive techniques consistently without deceptive rhetorical moves, which is commendable in this debate.\n\nHowever, there were moments where their use of emotionally charged language manipulation tactics could have been more circumspect.
